    <h1>Snakes</h1>
    <p>
      Snakes are some of the most feared animals, up there with spiders and
      centipedes for many. Some people even suffer from ophidiophobia, an
      intense fear of snakes. This fear is not unfounded. Our bodies have
      evolved to fear animals that could potentially harm us, and some snakes
      certainly can be deadly.
